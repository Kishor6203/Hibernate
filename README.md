Hibernate CRUD Operations Example

This project demonstrates the implementation of Hibernate ORM for managing database operations in a Java application. The app performs the following CRUD operations on an entity (e.g., Product):

Create: Insert new records into the database.
Read: Retrieve records from the database.
Update: Modify existing records in the database.
Delete: Remove records from the database.

The project uses a basic Product entity as an example, but it can be easily adapted for any entity.
